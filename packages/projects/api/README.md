# Aquaty_Project

A package generated by "GraphQL API package" scaffold.

Contains basic data model with GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and manipulate the data.

##### Files
All the code is located under the `src` directory.
- es.ts - Elasticsearch query helpers
- graphql.ts - Schema definitions for your Project data model
- index.ts - A `GraphQLSchemaPlugin` which connects the GraphQL schema and the resolvers.
- types.ts - Type definitions used throughout the application
- utils.ts - Configuration helpers
- resolvers - Directory containing all the resolvers

### Install

```
yarn add Aquaty_Project
```

### Import package into the GraphQL API file

```ts title="api/code/graphql/src/index.ts"
// at the top of the file
import projectPlugin from "Aquaty_Project";

// somewhere after headlessCmsPlugins() in the end of the createHandler() function
projectPlugin()
```

### Tests
From the project root, run:
```
LOCAL_ELASTICSEARCH=true yarn test packages/projects/api
```

Also, you can change the Elasticsearch port by setting `LOCAL_ELASTICSEARCH` variable, like this:
```
ELASTICSEARCH_PORT=9200 LOCAL_ELASTICSEARCH=true yarn test packages/projects/api
```

### Deploy the API
To deploy the API, run the deploy command:
```
yarn webiny deploy api --env=dev
```

### Elasticsearch
To create the Elasticsearch index, run the `install` mutation
```
mutation ProjectsInstallMutation {
    projects {
        install {
            data
            error {
                message
                code
                data
            }
        }
    }
}
```
in the API playground.

To delete the Elasticsearch index, run the `uninstall` mutation
```
mutation ProjectsUninstallMutation {
    projects {
        uninstall {
            data
            error {
                message
                code
                data
            }
        }
    }
}
```
in the API playground.
